    <h1>THE GLIB BARD FALLS IN LOVE</h1>
    <p>Allow me to apprise you, of the story I've been thinking,<br>
        of the girl I can watch, for days without blinking,<br>
        her eyes are like a dream I couldn't get out of,<br>
        oh, so mesmerizing, like the diamond on a crown's top,<br>
        it pains my heart, to even imagine how life would be,<br>
        how empty my arms shall feel, devoid of the warmth of she,<br>
        i love her eyes,, her hair, her face, her hands, her smile,<br>
        for even a glimpse of her, makes my day worthwhile,<br>
        holding hands and walking through the rain,<br>
        making out surreptitiously in the empty train,<br>
        her touch makes me forget things, her hugs make me remember,<br>
        i can never get enough of her, at the end of the day my heart feels like ember,<br>
        i love it when she looks at me, with a cheery smile on her face,<br>
        it makes me feel ecstatic, in so many simple ways,<br>
        surely, there are still so many ups and downs,<br>
        one moment we're philosophers, and the next we're clowns<br>
        she elevates my pigmy heart, with just her laugh,<br>
        everything that we do, others only dream of,<br>
        i think of her every second, she's all that comes to my mind,<br>
        i could never let go of her, only the reaper's scythe can undo this bind,<br>
        she is what i need, i have never been more certain of it,<br>
        for she has everything i could wish for, her beauty, her charms and her impish wit,<br>
        i wish to spend my whole life with her, to every last bit,<br>
        for she knows it too, like puzzle pieces we fit.<br>
        </p>
