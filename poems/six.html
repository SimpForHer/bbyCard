    <h1>requiem</h1>
    <p>i see nothing, just your eyes, just your smile,<br>
        oh, to hold your face, it's been a long while,<br>
        i wish, i hope, i beg, i pray,<br>
        please, god, please don't take her away,<br>
        for i love her, and i could never stop,<br>
        rather i wish, to stop breathing, lifeless shall i drop,<br>
        i cannot forget, nor do i wish to,<br>
        i cannot let her go, she's all there is true,<br>
        her smile, everything melts when i feel it's warmth,<br>
        her precious hands, it's been way too long,<br>
        her voice, i could never get enough of it,<br>
        her embrace, everything fades away from my wits,<br>
        i wish to see you, i wish to hold your hand,<br>
        i wish to change, to comfort you, just the way you want,<br>
        to keep you, but set you free,<br>
        to hold you, but let you breathe,<br>
        foolish, i was, to not see what I was doing to you,<br>
        how dumb i had to be, to not have a clue,<br>
        but i promise, it is not empty,<br>
        oh, sumona, you're the only one there ever will be,<br>
        if it's not you, i do not wish for another,<br>
        your love was everything for me, everything i still need,<br>
        i will fix myself, i will be your best, forever,<br>
        please, just this once, please hear me plead,<br>
        don't let go, i beg you, don't let your love die,<br>
        i will rebuild everything, i would never let you cry,<br>
        i hope you forgive me, i hope you be mine,<br>
        to accept the differences, even the mismatched puzzles shine,</p>
</body>
