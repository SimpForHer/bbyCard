    <h1>yearning of the mute</h1>
    <p>I see through the windows, towards the empty sky,<br>
        I see through myself, this cruel mind of mine,<br>
        All I can see, is still your smile,<br>
        Oh so wonderful, oh so full of glee,<br>
        Oh how I wish, the cause to be me,<br>
        Alas! like a rainbow, so wide and so bright,<br>
        Your eyes, so many colors, I pity this mind of mine,<br>
        Everything is so dull, it's almost black and white,<br>
        You barged in like the moon, in my cloudy dark nights,<br>
        I see, I feel, I think, I cry, I wish for the pitiful guy,<br>
        To be in your arms, when I kiss the world goodbye,<br>
        I feel and I feel, with my empty hands full of nothings,<br>
        I see and I see, with my empty eyes full of longings,<br>
        Just a little glimpse, just a little touch,<br>
        Do I dare ask for such things?<br>
        A word would melt my ears, smelt them into paradise,<br>
        Such is the feeling, the sweet ecstasy of your voice,<br>
        Oh how I wish, I could hold you,<br>
        Into my precious little doll, I would mold you,<br>
        I'll hold you close, I'll make your hair,<br>
        Even if I couldn't, I'll take you everywhere,</p>
</body>
