    <h1>greed of the depraved</h1>
    <p>perhaps i loved her too much,<br>
        and my obsession<br>
        made her feel suffocated,<br>
        overwhelming, bounded and such,<br>
        i did not mean to,<br>
        i would never,<br>
        but i was just too into her,<br>
        my love, became a cadaver,<br>
        maybe i,<br>
        am not what she searched for,<br>
        just a needy, depraved beggar,<br>
        neither sagacious, happy nor,<br>
        i asked for too much,<br>
        for someone who couldn't even go down her crust,<br>
        i yearned for something undeserved,<br>
        my insecurities threatened her trust,<br>
        will she leave me?<br>
        will I be alone?<br>
        have i overdone it?<br>
        will she, too, be gone?<br>
        am I not to expect,<br>
        what i think i deserve,<br>
        attention, attention and respect,<br>
        to be treated equal on this curve,<br>
        to be told i am loved,<br>
        it is not what the devil tells me,<br>
        she finds me pleasant and loveable,<br>
        certainly does not resent me,<br>
        would she tell me what i wish to hear?<br>
        what we have will go on, the end is not near,<br>
        i do not wish to start anew,<br>
        conclusions are something i still fear,<br>
        i just wish she would treat me,<br>
        like i am truly her dear,<br>
        tell me that she loves me,<br>
        more than anything near,<br>
        hold my hands, watch my eyes,<br>
        wrap her arms around me, hear my cries,<br>
        or was i just a replacement?<br>
        something to fill the space,<br>
        for i feel her resentment,<br>
        growing every passing day,<br>
        i do not know,<br>
        i can not feel,<br>
        oh i wish i could tell her,<br>
        everything over a pleasant meal,<br>
        i do not understand,<br>
        what lies underneath her veil,<br>
        does she simply not miss me,<br>
        is what we have really real?<br>
        </p>
