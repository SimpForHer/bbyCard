    <h1>in the edifice of philters</h1>
    <p>a love potion, i wish i could give you,<br>
        to keep you by my side forever, beyond and through,<br>
        i would use hundreds of them, for even a miniscule chance,<br>
        for i will never find another, this feeling of vigorous romance,<br>
        i see you, with every sense i can muster,<br>
        everything else in that moment, feels like an inexistent cluster,<br>
        i forget everything, but i still remember,<br>
        the feeling of your hands on my skin, oh so tender,<br>
        the words you speak, the euphoria you bring,<br>
        words can never describe you enough, you precious precious thing,<br>
        we talk everyday, from morning to morning,<br>
        every second without you, leaves me sad and horny,<br>
        you made me feel this love, one that i never imagined,<br>
        oh, if you don't remember, your chat is still pinned,<br>
        i feel everything with you, you really are what i need,<br>
        i can never get enough of you, it is an insatiable greed,<br>
        you are everything i could have asked for, i know it so well,<br>
        i still wonder what deeds i did, how, for me you fell,<br>
        i do not know if i say it enough, but know that i love you,<br>
        over and over and over again, until the sun turns blue,<br>
        you are my missing puzzle piece, you know that i match you,<br>
        trust me, i will hold your hand, but i can also catch you.</p>
